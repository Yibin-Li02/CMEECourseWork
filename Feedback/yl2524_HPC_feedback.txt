Marks for main questions
Q 0 :    3 / 3
Q 1 :    3.5 / 4    comments: text answer was not exactly correct - long term stability is the same with either initial condition and the way it's described suggests these functions are stochastic when they are not.
Q 2 :    3 / 3
Q 3 :    10 / 10
Q 4 :    10 / 10
Q 5 :    8 / 8
Q 6 :    10 / 10
Q 7 :    2 / 2
Q 8 :    1 / 1
Q 9 :    1 / 1
Q 10 :    2 / 2
Q 11 :    2 / 2
Q 12 :    2 / 2
Q 13 :    2 / 2
Q 14 :    2 / 3    comments: Technical results were very good but the text was not accurate - this isn't about genetic drift and the answer focused on description much more than reasoning why
Q 15 :    3 / 3
Q 16 :    1 / 1
Q 17 :    1 / 1
Q 18 :    4 / 4
Q 19 :    3 / 3
Q 20 :    1 / 3    comments: octaves(c(100,64,63,5,4,3,2,2,1,1,1,1)) does not evaluate as c(4,3,2,0,0,1,2)), this is an error
Q 21 :    2 / 2
Q 22 :    2 / 4    comments: the result was wrong - I think because this line " community_max <- neutral_time_series_speciation(community_max, speciation_rate, duration)" returns a time series, but the time series is being used as a community vector which was not intended - so this is a data format mixup
Q 23 :    6 / 6
Q 24 :    6 / 6
Q 25 :    10 / 10
Q 26 :    10 / 10
          ---------
Total     110.5 / 116
          ---------
 
Marks for text quality :  5.8 /8
Comments...
In question 1 well written but shows some lack of deep understanding about the system
In question 2 excellent
In question 5 very good but could have explained more clearly the benefit to the population of starting with all adults when the total population size is the same
In question 6 excellent
In question 14 needed to give more reasoning why rather than just being descriptive
In question 18 excellent
In question 22 good but could have gone deeper into the explanation mentioning dynamic equilibrium
 
Marks for graphics quality :  8.6 /10
Comments...
In question 1 very good, but the legend obscures the data - a different positioning would have been ideal
In question 2 as above - very good just the legend placement isn't ideal
In question 5 very good but could have had a bit more attention to detail e.g. use of '_' in the legend text and use of grid rather than axes
In question 6 excellent
In question 14 excellent
In question 18 exemplary
In question 22 good but would benefit from full octaves labels (1,2-3, 4-7 and so on) as well as higher resolution output and full text title instead of shortened title
In question 26 good but needed full octaves labels (1,2-3,4-7 and so on) as well as fully complete panel title (not just '1000') and axes rather than grids on each panel
 
Marks for code quality :  7.5 /8
Comments...
excellent very well engineered
 
Marks for challenge questions :  10 /14
Comments...
challenge question A, very good but some minor issues with the plot - the legend would be better with clear lines and I prefer axes to grids.  A higher resolution would help as well
challenge question B, Good but the system likely reaches equilibrium much sooner than stated in the answer. I think plotting this for fewer generations would be preferable as would removing the box from the legend.
challenge question C, excellent
challenge question D, very good, I would suggest showing less of the x axis so the approach to equilibrium is more of a focus
challenge question E, good attempt but unfortunately not correct, coalescence doesn't replicate the forward in time simulations.
