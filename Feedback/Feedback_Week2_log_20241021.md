# Feedback for Yibin on Project Structure, Workflow, and Python Code

## Project Structure and Workflow

### General Structure
- **Repository Layout**: The overall structure is well-organized with directories like `week1`, `week2`, `sandbox`, `code`, `data`, and `results`. However, the directory contains some extra files such as `csv` files that should be stored in a `data` folder. Non-essential files or outputs should not be tracked in the repository.
- **README Files**:
  - The `README.md` file in the parent directory is too minimal, providing only the repository name. It should include a general overview of the project, key dependencies, and installation/setup instructions.
  - The `README.md` in `week2` provides a brief overview of the scripts and their functions but would benefit from detailed instructions on how to run each script, expected inputs/outputs, and any dependencies.

### Workflow
- **Results Directory**: The `results` directory is empty, which is good practice. Ensure that output files generated by the scripts are not tracked in version control, and consider adding a `.gitkeep` file to maintain the directory structure.
- **Extra Files**: Some unnecessary files (e.g., `csv` and system files) are found in the main directories. Ensure they are moved to `data` or excluded if not needed to maintain a clean repository structure.

## Python Code Feedback

### General Code Quality
- **PEP 8 Compliance**: The code generally adheres to Pythonâ€™s style guidelines, but some scripts are missing docstrings and comments. Strict adherence to PEP 8 (proper spacing, indentation) will improve code readability.
- **Docstrings**: Many scripts lack docstrings, both at the script and function levels. Every function should have a docstring explaining its purpose, parameters, and return values. The script itself should include a high-level docstring to describe the script's purpose.
- **Error Handling**: Some scripts assume the existence of certain input files (e.g., `csv` files) without verifying their presence. Adding file existence checks and handling errors (using `try-except`) would make the code more robust.

### Detailed Code Review

#### `align_seqs.py`
- **Modularization**: The sequence alignment logic is functional but could be broken into smaller functions to make the code more readable and maintainable.
- **Docstrings**: Missing function-level docstrings, despite the presence of a script-level docstring. Adding these would make it easier for others to understand the purpose and functionality of each function.
- **Error Handling**: Add checks to verify that input files are present and correctly formatted before proceeding with the main logic.

#### `cfexercises1.py`
- **Redundancy**: The script contains multiple factorial functions (`foo_4`, `foo_5`, `foo_6`), which could be consolidated into a single function demonstrating different approaches (iterative and recursive) to avoid code duplication.
- **Docstrings**: Some functions have basic docstrings, but they could be expanded to provide more detail on expected inputs and outputs.

#### `oaks_debugme.py`
- **Doctests**: The script contains useful doctests for the `is_an_oak` function, but more edge cases should be tested to ensure that the function handles a wider variety of inputs.
- **Error Handling**: The script does not check for missing input files. Adding file existence checks and proper error handling would make the script more robust.

#### `dictionary.py`
- **Dictionary Operations**: The script works as expected, populating a dictionary from species data. However, it would benefit from a script-level docstring explaining the overall purpose of the script.

#### `lc1.py` and `lc2.py`
- **List Comprehensions**: Both scripts demonstrate good use of list comprehensions but lack sufficient docstrings. Each script should have a high-level docstring explaining its purpose, and list comprehensions should be accompanied by comments for clarity.

#### `tuple.py`
- **Functionality**: This script prints bird data using loops. The functionality is solid, but it lacks any comments or docstrings to explain its purpose. Adding these will make the code more understandable.

#### `control_flow.py`
- **Docstrings**: Some functions have docstrings, but the overall script lacks a high-level description. Adding a script-level docstring would make it easier for users to understand its purpose.

### Final Remarks
The project demonstrates a solid understanding of Python fundamentals, including control flow, list comprehensions, and file handling. However, the following improvements are recommended:
1. Add detailed docstrings to all scripts and functions to enhance clarity.
2. Implement robust error handling for file operations to prevent crashes.
3. Remove unnecessary or redundant files and ensure that the repository remains clean and organized.
