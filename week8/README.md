## Introduction

This coursework contains multiple R scripts and data files demonstrating various computational tasks for Week 8.



## Language and Dependency

-   **R**: The scripts are written in R programming language.
-   **Dependency**: To run the R scripts, an R environment (version 4.0 or higher) is required with the following packages installed:
    -   `dplyr` for data manipulation
    -   `ggplot2` for data visualization
    -   `tidyr` for data tidying
    -   `cluster` for clustering analysis
    -   `vegan` for ecological data analysis
    -   `parallel` for parallel computing



## Description of Code Files

The `code` directory includes several R scripts that perform different tasks:

-   **Demographic.R**: Script for demographic data analysis, including data wrangling and visualization.

-   **Yibin.Li24_HPC_2024_main.R**: Main script for running simulations and coordinating different components of the analysis.

-   **Yibin.Li24_HPC_2024_demographic_cluster.R**: Implements clustering analysis on demographic data.

-   **Yibin.Li24_HPC_2024_neutral_cluster.R**: Performs clustering analysis using a neutral model for comparison.

-   **Yibin.Li24_HPC_2024_test.R**: Script used for testing and validating the methods and simulations.


## Data

The `data` directory is empty.



## Results

The `results` directory contains the outputs generated by the scripts after processing the data. This includes clustering results, demographic plots, and summary statistics.

Currently, the `results` directory is empty.



## Sandbox

The `sandbox` directory contains test files and scripts.
