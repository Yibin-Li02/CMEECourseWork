abstract = {Development of effective heat treatments is crucial to achieve food products’ safety, and predictive microbiology is an excellent tool to design adequate processing conditions. This work focuses on the application of a modified Gompertz model to describe the inactivation behaviour under time-varying temperature conditions at the surface of a food product. Kinetic studies were carried out assuming two different heating regimes, typically used in surface pasteurisation treatments, and compared with isothermal conditions. Parameters were estimated on the basis of generated pseudo-experimental data. It was concluded that the heating period greatly affects microbial inactivation and parameter estimation. If a slow heating treatment is used, the process time should be extended to achieve a given microbial load when compared to a fast heating process. This is explained by the fact that, in the slow heating rate process the temperature was below the lowest temperature for inactivation for a much longer time, in comparison with the fast heating regime.}

abstract = {The identifiability properties of the Baranyi model for bacterial growth were investigated, both structurally and applied to real-life data. Using the Taylor-series approach, it was formally proven that the model is structurally identifiable, i.e. it is now ascertained that it is certainly possible to give unique values to all parameters of the model, provided the bacterial growth data are of sufficiently good quality. The model also has acceptable practical identifiability properties in the presence of realistic data, which means that the confidence intervals on the parameter values are reasonable. However, there was a relatively high correlation between the maximum specific growth rate μmaxand the suitability indicator h0. An optimal experimental design to improve parameter estimation uncertainty was worked out, using the sampling times of the microbial growth curve as experimental degree of freedom. Using a D-optimal design criterion, it could be shown that the optimal sampling times were concentrated in four time periods (initial, start and end of exponential growth, end of experiment), each providing maximum information on a particular parameter. Because the optimal experimental design requires a priori estimates of the parameters, the propagation of the parameter uncertainty into the experimental design was assessed with a Monte Carlo simulation. In this way, 95% confidence intervals could be established around the optimal sampling times to be used in the optimal experiment. Based on these intervals, a design was proposed and experimentally validated. The error on the parameter estimates was more than halved, their correlation diminished and the nonlinearity of the result improved.}

abstract = {Summary 1. Plant growth is a fundamental ecological process, integrating across scales from physiology to community dynamics and ecosystem properties. Recent improvements in plant growth modelling have allowed deeper understanding and more accurate predictions for a wide range of ecological issues, including competition among plants, plant–herbivore interactions and ecosystem functioning. 2. One challenge in modelling plant growth is that, for a variety of reasons, relative growth rate (RGR) almost universally decreases with increasing size, although traditional calculations assume that RGR is constant. Nonlinear growth models are flexible enough to account for varying growth rates. 3. We demonstrate a variety of nonlinear models that are appropriate for modelling plant growth and, for each, show how to calculate function-derived growth rates, which allow unbiased comparisons among species at a common time or size. We show how to propagate uncertainty in estimated parameters to express uncertainty in growth rates. Fitting nonlinear models can be challenging, so we present extensive worked examples and practical recommendations, all implemented in R. 4. The use of nonlinear models coupled with function-derived growth rates can facilitate the testing of novel hypotheses in population and community ecology. For example, the use of such techniques has allowed better understanding of the components of RGR, the costs of rapid growth and the linkage between host and parasite growth rates. We hope this contribution will demystify nonlinear modelling and persuade more ecologists to use these techniques.},

abstract = {Simple forecast combinations such as medians and trimmed or winsorized means are known to improve the accuracy of point forecasts, and Akaike’s Information Criterion (AIC) has given rise to so-called Akaike weights, which have been used successfully to combine statistical models for inference and prediction in specialist fields, e.g., ecology and medicine. We examine combining exponential smoothing point and interval forecasts using weights derived from AIC, small-sample-corrected AIC and BIC on the M1 and M3 Competition datasets. Weighted forecast combinations perform better than forecasts selected using information criteria, in terms of both point forecast accuracy and prediction interval coverage. Simple combinations and weighted combinations do not consistently outperform one another, while simple combinations sometimes perform worse than single forecasts selected by information criteria. We find a tendency for a longer history to be associated with a better prediction interval coverage.}
