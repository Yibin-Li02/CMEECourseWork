# This command moves to the specified working directory where the data files are located.

# 1. Count how many lines there are in each file
# This command counts the number of lines in each of the .fasta files and prints the filename along with the line count.

echo "407228326.fasta: "; (cat 407228326.fasta; echo) | wc -l; echo "407228412.fasta: "; (cat 407228412.fasta; echo) | wc -l; echo "E.coli.fasta: "; (cat E.coli.fasta; echo) | wc -l

# 2. Print everything starting from the second line for the E. coli genome
# This command prints all lines from the second line onwards for the specified file, excluding the header line (often containing metadata).

tail -n +2 E.coli.fasta

# 3. Count the sequence length of each genome
# This command iterates over all .fasta files, removes the header line, joins all lines into one (removing newlines), and counts the total number of characters (nucleotides).

# 4. Count the matches of a particular sequence, "ATGC", in the genome of E. coli
# This command removes the header line, concatenates the sequence into a single line, and counts the occurrences of "ATGC" in the sequence.

grep -v ">" E.coli.fasta | tr -d '\n' | grep -o "ATGC" | wc -l 

# 5. Compute the AT/GC ratio
# This command calculates the AT to GC ratio for each .fasta file by counting the occurrences of A, T, G, and C bases.
# It ignores header lines, removes newlines, and then computes the ratio of total A and T to total G and C bases.
