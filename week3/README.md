This directory contains R scripts, data and results for Week 3.

## Code:

1.apply1

A .R script looking at using apply on some of R's inbuilt functions.

2.apply2

A .R script contains the function that is used to manipulate rows of a matrix based on the sum of their elements, allowing for conditional scaling of the data within each row.

3.basic_io

A .R script to illustrate R input-output.

4.bolierplate

A .R script with an example function and test print outs.

5.break

A .R script that uses ```break``` to break out of a simple loop.

6.browse 

A .R script that inserts a breakpoint into the code and enters browser mode.

7.control_flow

A .R script that illustrates different control flow tools.

8.DataWrang

A .R script that wrangles a dataset called "PoundHillData" found in the data directory.

9.Girko

A .R script that plots Girko's circular law and saves figure as a pdf.

10.MyBars

A .R script that loads data from a .txt file and plots it as three line ranges with annotations for particular values.

11.MyData

A .R that illustrates data manipulation and handling in R, focusing on reading from and writing to CSV files while ensuring data integrity throughout the process.

12.next

A .R script that uses next to ```skip``` to the next iteration of a loop.

13.plotLin

A .R script that demonstrates the relationship between two variables using linear regression and visually present this relationship, along with the residuals, in a clear and informative plot.

14.preallocate

A .R script that contains two methods of creating a matrix.

15.Pred_Prey_Overlay

A .R script performs a series of data manipulations and visualizations on a dataset regarding predator-prey interactions.

16.R_conditional

A .R script defines three functions to perform specific mathematical checks.

17.sample

A .R script that contains 6 functions to test the speed of 5 different methods of calculating means.

18.Treeheight

A .R script tcalculates heights of trees, using the trigonometric formula.

19.try

A .R script to practise catching errors and debugging.

20.Vectorize1

A .R script defines a function to sum all elements of a matrix using two different approaches.
